       <h3>Summary</h3>
       <p>Highly motivated graduate of Fullstack Academy’s DevOps Bootcamp. During the bootcamp I gained hands on experience with a wide variety of AWS services including IAM, EC2, and Lambda, as well as industry tools such as Ansible, Docker and Terraform. I believe the skills I learned in bootcamp, combined with my my professional experience working in the medical field will allow me to become a valuable member of your engineering team.</p>
